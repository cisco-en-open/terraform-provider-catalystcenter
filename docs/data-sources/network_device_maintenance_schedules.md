  It performs read operation on Devices.
  This data source retrieves a list of scheduled maintenance windows for network devices based on filter parameters.
  Each maintenance window is composed of a start schedule and end schedule, both of which have unique

  schedule using the GET /dna/intent/api/v1/activities/{id} API. Completed maintenance schedules are automatically

# catalystcenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Devices.

- This data source retrieves a list of scheduled maintenance windows for network devices based on filter parameters.
Each maintenance window is composed of a start schedule and end schedule, both of which have unique
identifiers(**startId** and **endId**). These identifiers can be used to fetch the status of the start schedule and end
schedule using the **GET /dna/intent/api/v1/activities/{id}** API. Completed maintenance schedules are automatically
removed from the system after two weeks. The API returns a paginated response based on 'limit' and 'offset' parameters,
allowing up to 500 records per page. 'limit' specifies the number of records, and 'offset' sets the starting point using
1-based indexing. Use '/dna/intent/api/v1/networkDeviceMaintenanceSchedules/count' API to get the total record count.
For data sets over 500 records, make multiple calls, adjusting 'limit' and 'offset' to retrieve all records
incrementally.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "catalystcenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules" "example" {
  provider           = catalystcenter
  limit              = "string"
  network_device_ids = "string"
  offset             = "string"
  order              = "string"
  sort_by            = "string"
  status             = "string"
}

output "catalystcenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules_example" {
  value = data.catalystcenter_network_device_maintenance_schedules.example.items
}
```
