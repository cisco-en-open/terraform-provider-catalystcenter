# catalystcenter_device_replacement (Data Source)

It performs read operation on Device Replacement.

- Get list of replacement devices with replacement details and it can filter replacement devices based on Faulty Device
Name,Faulty Device Platform, Replacement Device Platform, Faulty Device Serial Number,Replacement Device Serial Number,
Device Replacement status, Product Family.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "catalystcenter_device_replacement" "example" {
  provider                         = catalystcenter
  family                           = ["string"]
  faulty_device_name               = "string"
  faulty_device_platform           = "string"
  faulty_device_serial_number      = "string"
  limit                            = 1
  offset                           = 1
  replacement_device_platform      = "string"
  replacement_device_serial_number = "string"
  replacement_status               = ["string"]
  sort_by                          = "string"
  sort_order                       = "string"
}

output "catalystcenter_device_replacement_example" {
  value = data.catalystcenter_device_replacement.example.items
}
