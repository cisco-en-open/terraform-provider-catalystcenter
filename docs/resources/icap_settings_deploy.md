~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in CatalystCenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_icap_settings_deploy" "example" {
  provider            = catalystcenter
  preview_description = "string"
  parameters = [{

    apid              = "string"
    capture_type      = "string"
    client_mac        = "string"
    duration_in_mins  = 1
    ota_band          = "string"
    ota_channel       = 1
    ota_channel_width = 1
    slot              = []
    wlc_id            = "string"
  }]
