~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in CatalystCenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_intent_network_devices_query_count" "example" {
  provider = catalystcenter
  parameters = [{

    filter = [{

      filters = [{

        key      = "string"
        operator = "string"
        value    = "string"
      }]
      logical_operator = "string"
    }]
  }]
}

output "catalystcenter_intent_network_devices_query_count_example" {
