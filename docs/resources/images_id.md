~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in CatalystCenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_images_id" "example" {
  provider = catalystcenter
  id       = "string"
  parameters {

  }
}

output "catalystcenter_images_id_example" {
  value = catalystcenter_images_id.example
}
