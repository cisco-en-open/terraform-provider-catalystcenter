~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in CatalystCenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_network_profiles_for_sites_site_assignments_bulk_delete" "example" {
  provider   = catalystcenter
  profile_id = "string"
  site_id    = "string"
  parameters = [{

  }]
}

output "catalystcenter_network_profiles_for_sites_site_assignments_bulk_delete_example" {
  value = catalystcenter_network_profiles_for_sites_site_assignments_bulk_delete.example
