  It performs create operation on Fabric Wireless.
  This data source action is used to reload switches after disabling wireless to remove the wireless-controller
  configuration on the device. When wireless is disabled on a switch, all wireless configurations are removed except for
  the wireless-controller configuration. To completely remove the wireless-controller configuration, you can use this API.
  Please note that using this API will cause a reload of the device(s). This data source action should only be used for
  devices that have wireless disabled but still have the 'wireless-controller' configuration present. The reload payload
  can have a maximum of two switches as only two switches can have a wireless role in a fabric site.

~>**Warning:**
This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Cisco Catalyst Center, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect.
Instead, it is a task part of a Cisco Catalyst Center workflow. It is executed in CatalystCenter without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_fabrics_fabric_id_switch_wireless_setting_reload" "example" {
  provider  = catalystcenter
  fabric_id = "string"
  parameters = [{

    device_id = "string"
  }]
}

output "catalystcenter_fabrics_fabric_id_switch_wireless_setting_reload_example" {
  value = catalystcenter_fabrics_fabric_id_switch_wireless_setting_reload.example
}
```
