# Wired Device Provision Configuration
# Enable/disable wired device provisioning and specify device IP

# ==============================================================================
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMIZATION:
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. REQUIRED CHANGES:
#    - Update site_name_hierarchy with your actual site hierarchy
#    - Replace all management_ip values with your actual device IPs
#    - Update managed_ap_locations with your actual AP site locations
#
# 2. WORKFLOW SELECTION:
#    - Set enabled = true for the workflows you want to test
#    - Set enabled = false for workflows you don't need
#    - At least one workflow must be enabled
#
# 3. DEVICE REQUIREMENTS:
#    - Ensure all specified devices exist in your Catalyst Center inventory
#    - Devices should be discovered and reachable
#    - Site hierarchy must exist in your Catalyst Center
#
# 4. NETWORK ACCESS:
#    - Ensure Terraform can reach your Catalyst Center instance
#    - Verify authentication credentials are properly configured
#    - Check that all device IPs are accessible from Catalyst Center
#
# 5. TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
#    - Start with site_assignment_only = true to test basic connectivity
#    - Enable wired_device_provision for basic provisioning test
#    - Enable wireless_device_provision only if you have wireless controllers
#    - Use device_reprovision carefully on production devices
#
# 6. TROUBLESHOOTING:
#    - Keep enable_debug = true during initial testing
#    - Increase timeout values if operations take longer in your environment
#    - Check Catalyst Center logs for detailed error information
